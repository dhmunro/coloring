**huecmaps**
  A set of seven carefully matched perceptually uniform sequential
  colormaps.  These are tinted gray scales, designed particularly for
  displaying multiple data sets (say density and temperature) in side
  by side filled mesh plots, or to distinuguish several adjacent
  materials when plotting a single quantity (say density of fuel and
  ablator).
